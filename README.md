Microservice in Golang
======================================

Shipping container management platform is an example application made in Golang
to put the microservice architecture into practice using [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) and [protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) for internal communications.

The example is built based on [blog posts](https://ewanvalentine.io/tag/go/).
